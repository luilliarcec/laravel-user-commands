If like me, you have ever considered having commands to manipulate users within your application, 
this package will help you.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require luilliarcec/laravel-user-commands
```

Now publish the configuration file into your app's config directory, by running the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Luilliarcec\UserCommands\UserCommandsServiceProvider"
```

That is all. ðŸ˜€

## Usage

The package has 4 basic commands

| Commands | Description |
| -- | -- |
| user:create | Create a new user in your app |
| user:reset-password | Restore a user's password |
| user:delete | Delete a user |
| user:restore | Restore a user |

### Create Users

```bash
php artisan user:create
```

The create command has 3 mandatory entries 
(`name`, `email` and `password`) also if your user model has more attributes you can pass it 
inline in the following way.

```bash
php artisan user:create -a username:larcec -a "other_field:Value of field"
```

or

```bash
php artisan user:create --attributes=username:larcec --attributes="other_field:Value of field"
```

If you want to mark the user's email as verified you can pass the argument `--verified` Ex.:

```bash
php artisan user:create --verified
```

If your model uses roles and permissions, 
you must configure the model of the roles and permissions and the name of the relationships 
in the configuration file.

You can then pass the permissions or roles as arguments.

```bash
php artisan user:create -p "user-create" -p "user-edit"
```

It should be noted that the `roles` and `permissions`  
must already exist in your database and will be searched by the `name` field

Once the user has been created, 
the `notification` that it has been created will be sent if it implements 
the `MustVerifyEmail` interface and if the `verification.verify` route name exists

### Reset Password User

The command to `reset password user` receives the value parameter as required. 
It will be searched by `email` and if it is not found it will be searched by `id`

```bash
php artisan user:reset-password luis@email.com
```

However if you want to search for a specific field you can pass it after the value

```bash
php artisan user:reset-password larcec username
```

After executing the command it will ask you to enter a new password and confirm it

### Delete Users

In the same way as the command to `reset password user`, 
the user is searched by email or id or by specifying a specific field.

```bash
php artisan user:delete luis@email.com
```

or

```bash
php artisan user:delete larcec username
```

If your model uses logical elimination, 
this is executed by default, 
however if you want to eliminate completely you can pass the --force argument

```bash
php artisan user:delete larcec username --force
```

### Restore Users

In the same way as the command to `reset password user`, 
the user is searched by email or id or by specifying a specific field.

```bash
php artisan user:restore luis@email.com
```

or

```bash
php artisan user:restore larcec username
```

Note that this command will only run if your model uses SoftDelete trait

## Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
